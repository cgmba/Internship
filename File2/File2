a) 𝛽₀, 𝛽₁, …, 𝛽ᵣ are the regression coefficients
22 What indicates that you have a perfect fit in linear regression?
d) The value 𝑅² = 1, which corresponds to SSR = 0
23) In simple linear regression, the value of what shows the point where the estimated regression line crosses the 𝑦 axis?
b) B0
24) Check out these four linear regression plots:
Which one represents an underfitted model?
d) The top-left plot
25) There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:
d) d, b, e, a, c
