64) Lasso can be interpreted as least-squares linear regression where
(A) weights are regularized with the l1 norm

65) Consider the problem of binary classification. Assume I trained a model on a linearly separable training set, and now I have a new labeled data point that the model properly categorized and is far away from the decision border. In which instances is the learnt decision boundary likely to change if I now add this additional point to my previous training set and re-train? When the training model is,
(B) Logistic regression and Gaussian discriminant analysis

66) Assume youâ€™ve discovered multi-collinear features. Which of the following actions do you intend to take next? (1). Both collinear variables should be removed. (2). Instead of deleting both variables, we can simply delete one. (3). Removing correlated variables may result in information loss. We may utilize penalized regression models such as ridge or lasso regression to keep such variables.
(D) Either 2 or 3
